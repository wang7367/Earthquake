# CSci-4611 Assignment 3:  Earthquake
Jake Wang

#Work in the "C" range:

1. I used the MinGfx::Mesh class to draw a rectangle subdivided into multiple triangles, which is the flat map mesh of the Earth
2. It lies in the xy plane
3. x value ranging from -180 to 180 degrees
4. I divided the mesh into 10x10 divisions horizontally and vertically

#Work in the "B" range:
1. I applied the 2k texture of the Earth to the rectangle mesh.
2. I also displayed all the earthquakes on the Earth. I chose to simple small spheres with radius of 0.03 as the earthquake markers and I used yellow color for the spheres so that they are clearly visible from the Earth. 

#Work in the "A" range:
1. The Earth can be drawn as a sphere.
2. The normals are set correctly on the sphere, the lighting on the globe looks good.
3. The earthquakes would appear on the sphere if the globe button is pressed and they are in the correct geographical locations.
4. I made the mesh can be smoothly morphed between the flat map and the globe based on user input, and the program starts with the flat map.
